# BlockerZ

## CURRENT DESIGN:

### DESIGN A:
* block falls from one random horizontal point automatically, user turns the platform either clockwise or counter-clockwise direction.

### DESIGN B: 
_(better way)_

* user decides where the block will fall from horizontally by touching and sliding (holding). The block follows the touch's horizontal position and falls. Platform turns automatically in the clockwise direction.

#### DONE
* touch input with sliding and platform turns
* added a new touch input hold and slide to decide where the block will fall from **( B )**
* falling and spawning of blocks
#### IN PROGRESS

## FIRST DESIGN FROM GAME DESIGN COURSE:

Now I'm developing the game as a mobile game. The very first design of this idea can be found here, it was designed as a table game in the beginning for our Game Design course (SE 350):

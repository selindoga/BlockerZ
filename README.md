# BlockerZ

### DESIGN A:
* block falls from one random horizontal point automatically, user turns the platform either clockwise or counter-clockwise direction.

### DESIGN B: 
_(new better way)_

* user decides where the block will fall from horizontally by touching and sliding (holding). The block follows the touch's horizontal position and falls. Platform turns automatically in the clockwise direction.

#### DONE
* touch input with sliding and platform turns

* falling and spawning of blocks
#### IN PROGRESS 
* will add a new touch input hold and slide to decide where the block will fall from

* (_**maybe**_ will remove the other touch input in the later when the the basics of the game finishes)
